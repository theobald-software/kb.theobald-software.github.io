Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 needs Update 2, otherwise you can't edit the connection properties for the DataSource in Xtract RS.

You can find information on the Visual Studio Update 2 [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927432/description-of-visual-studio-2013-update-2).

After successfully updating Visual Studio 2012 and restarting your machine the edit button for the DataSource works well.
