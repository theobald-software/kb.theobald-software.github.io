It is possible to use SSIS Variables in the Xtract IS DeltaQ Dialog to dynamize the packages. First create SSIS Variables like shown in the following screenshot:

![SSISVariablesInDeltaQComp_00](/img/contents/SSISVariablesInDeltaQComp_00.png){:class="img-responsive"}

If done, you can use the SSIS Variables in the DeltaQ component in the corresponding fields:

![SSISVariablesInDeltaQComp](/img/contents/SSISVariablesInDeltaQComp.png){:class="img-responsive"}
