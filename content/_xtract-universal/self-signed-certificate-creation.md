**Content** <br>
This article describes how a self-signed certificate could be created easily for testing purposes. Please note that the procedure for certificate creation in your company could differ completely from this guide.  

For Transport encryption and authentication in Xtract Universal it is required to [install an X.509 certificate]](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/security/install-x.509-Certificate).

There are two approaches for creating an X.509 certificate:

- Certificate released by an (internal) certification authority (CA)
- Self-signed certificate
