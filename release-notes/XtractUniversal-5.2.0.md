# Xtract Universal 5.2

When updating to this version, server AND designer must be updated.
Running different versions together will result in crashes and/or strange behavior.

## Xtract Universal Designer

The designer received a lot of internal changes, which aim to improve stability and fix bugs, causing strange behavior and disconnects.

The window for browsing and viewing the logs of extractions and servers was rewritten.
This includes better performance and stability.

A Bug was fixed, where the designer did run into a corrupted state when a disconnect occured.

## Xtract Universal Server

The server which the designer talks to, now reports errors as JSON.
