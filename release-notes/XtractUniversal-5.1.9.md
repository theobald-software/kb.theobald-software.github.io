**Xtract Universal 5.1.9**

Tableau's files, from this version, will not be shipped anymore along with XtractUniversal's setup, therefore these files must be manually downloaded and placed in the correct place.

For more information about it, please check the *[Tableau destination documentation page](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/destinations/tableau "Xtract Universal docu")*
