# Xtract IS 6.5.0

The command line interface (CLI) of the setup application has changed. 

## Parameters

The setup now supports the following parameters:

- **`--no-gui`** runs in console mode and prints log and status messages to stdout
- **`--silent`** runs in console mode and does not output anything to stdout

## Xtract IS for Azure

Because of the change to the CLI the *main.cmd* file needs to be updated.
