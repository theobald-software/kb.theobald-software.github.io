Check out our [OnlineHelp](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/) for further information.

When extracting BW queries with a huge amount of data it might be useful not to extract the whole result set at once (see also Transferring data packets with ReadTable class ).

The code sample below shows how to use the property 'PackageSize' and the event 'OnIncomingPackage'. The sample is shortened and is based on Executing BW Queries .

Set the PackageSize property to a reasonable value (e.g. 1000) and process each package within the IncomingPackage event. Before calling Execut e() the event handler must be set correctly to trigger the event.

**Attention! Packaging is limited to 1.000.000 rows due to SAP**
