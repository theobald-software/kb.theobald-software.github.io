**Xtract Universal 5.11.4**

When the append results setting is selected, Xtract Universal will map the columns from the running extraction with the existing Tableau file's (is there is one). The mapping is based on each column's name.

This is useful if an extraction has different columns' order when compared to existing Tableau file.

It is important to update the tableau folder on Xtract Universal's installation folder, for that download
the files from this [link](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/cdn-files.theobald-software.com/download/XtractUniversal/tableau.zip) and check the [Tableau documentation's page](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/destinations/tableau#requirements)
