**Error:**

When running a DeltaQ extraction the following exception occurs: DataSource XXX has to be replicated . 

**Reason:**

This Exception occurs when the DataSource XXX has to be replicated again. This could happen by former changes done on the SAP side.

**Solution:**

1. Clicking the button "Activate" in the DeltaQ component dialog.

2. Turning on the Option "Automatic Synchronization" in the Settings of the Xtract DeltaQ component to activate the package automatically at runtime.
