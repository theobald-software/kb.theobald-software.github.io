Please also have a look in our [OnlineHelp](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/) for further information.

BEx Queries are not accessible from external tools by default.
To extract data from BW Queries you have to allow the external access in the settings of the query in the Query Analyzer of SAP.

Set "Allow External Access to this Query" flag in the properties of the query as seen in the screenshot below.
