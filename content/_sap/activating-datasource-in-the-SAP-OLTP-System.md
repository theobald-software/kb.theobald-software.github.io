This article shows how to activate DataSources in your SAP system and make them available for Theobald Software products.

### About DataSources

A DataSource is a set of logically-related fields that are provided to transfer data into the BW.<br>
DataSources supply the metadata description of source data. 
They are used to extract data from a source system and to transfer the data to the BW system. 
For more information on DataSources, see [SAP Help: DataSource in the SAP Source System](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw73/helpdata/en/4a/0c98f779291b43e10000000a42189c/frameset.htm)

To find DataSources in your SAP system, the relevant DataSources must be activated.
To activate DataSources, follow the steps below. No SAP BW system is required.

### Activating DataSources

1. Run transaction *RSA9* to activate the Application Component Hierarchy.<br>
The Application Component Hierarchy is used to structure the DataSources in the Data Sources tree.<br>
Alternatively run the transaction *SBIW* and select **[Business Content DataSources] > [Transfer Application Component Hierarchy]**. 
2. Confirm the security check for the Application Component Hierarchy with **[YES]**. <br>
If a dialog box prompts you to enter a package, enter a package in the customerâ€™s namespace and click **[Save]** or click **[Local object]**.
3. Run transaction *RSA5* to access Transfer Business Content DataSources.<br> 
Alternatively run transaction *SBIW*, and select **[Business Content DataSources] > [Transfer Business Content DataSources]**.
4. Select a DataSource or a Node you want to activate from the overview tree.
5. Click **Activate DataSources** to activate the selected DataSources.
