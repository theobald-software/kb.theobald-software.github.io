# BOARD Connector 5.0

## SAP passwords are encrypted in context of BC Service Account (breaking)
When creating new sources or editing existing ones, the SAP passwords
are encrypted with a key that is derived from the Windows account that
is configured to run the BC service.
The passwords can only be accessed from the same service account,
when restoring a backup or moving the files to a different machine.
If the service account changes, passwords need to be re-entered manually.

## SAP passwords are stored seperately
Passwords are no longer part of sources\[name]\general.json.
They are stored in sources\[name]\password.json now.

## Various changes
* Using new TheoRPC implementation for Designer/Server communication
* Removed backward compatibility for custom users before BC 3.0
* Table Join extractions cannot be created any more
* Renamed BCWebServer.exe to Theobald.Bc.Web.Listener.exe
* Renamed BCRun.exe to Theobald.Bc.Web.Worker.exe
