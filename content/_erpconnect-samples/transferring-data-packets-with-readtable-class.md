Check out our [OnlineHelp](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/) for further information.

If you want to extract more than a certain number of table rows (between 100,000 and 1,000,000 depending on the system) it is not possible at once anymore. That's why the ReadTable class offers the Packaging mechanism that is explained in the following.

- Set the property PackageSize to a value greater than 0 to enable packaging.
- Set the property RaiseIncomingPackageEvent to true to enable the event to be raised when a new data packet has to be processed.
- Implement the IncomingPackage event to process each data packet. The packet will be provided as a Datatable object.
