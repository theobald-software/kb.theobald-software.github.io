## XtractUniversal 6.7.10

- Fixed a bug that would not display the extraction's data in the run window's output tab
- Fixed the extraction abortion operation in the run window and in the main window's grid menu
- Fixed the state change in the run window, which could cause undesired effects when an extraction was started before the last one was finished
- Added a progress dialog to the extraction abortion call from the main grid's menu for a better UX
