Please also have a look in our [OnlineHelp](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/) for further information.

You may be requested by a Theobald Software support technician to send Xtract trace files. 

To activate the tracing for Xtract products it is required to fill in a path in the field *TraceLog Directory* in the Xtract Connection Manager/SAP source as seen in the screenshot below.

When pulling extraction meta data or when running an extraction, xml files are created in the path specified in the *Trace Directory* field. 

Please zip the complete trace folder and attach it to the support ticket.

**Attention:** <br> XML Files are created in the path specified with the tracing information.

Please do not forget to delete the entry in the field after the tracing is not needed anymore.
