# New BICS feature: Member display 
Allows to define how members are displayed in result set: "Text", "Key" or "Text and Key". Selecting "Text and Key" will add an additional column for each selected dimension and property containing the key.

# Improved metadata retrieval
Improved the metadata retrieval especially when using BEx Queries with mandatory variables. 

# Internal improvements
Internal improvements to increase extraction performance and stability. The "BICS Fast Mode" is not available anymore because of an improved, more efficient extraction logic.
