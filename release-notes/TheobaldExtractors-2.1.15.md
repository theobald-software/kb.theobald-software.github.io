- Updated Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT to version 1.3. Added functionality for fetching values of variant selections and parameters.
- Selection and parameter values of selected variants are now displayed directly in selection screen, allowing users to identify required variants and change variant selection and parameter values more easily. __This feature requires an update of Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT to version 1.3.__
- Selection and parameter values can now be supplied in output format, even if multiple values for a single selection are provided. This makes it much easier to work with the selection screen, since users don't have to know the internal representation of the fields in SAP to use them. __This feature requires an update of Z_XTRACT_IS_REMOTE_REPORT to version 1.3.__
