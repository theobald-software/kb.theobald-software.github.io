## Multiple UI fixes and usability improvements
- Fixed a bug where an error would be thrown when trying to edit joins on same tables
- Window for JOIN definitions now doesn't allow to define joins without specifying tables
- It is no longer possible to add joins in extraction that has no tables defined
