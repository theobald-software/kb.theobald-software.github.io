Check out our [OnlineHelp](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/) for further information.

This code snippet shows how to obtain an Equipment list. You can use the function module BAPI_EQUI_GETLIST or the business object method PieceOfEquipment.GetList.

The function module offers so called selection ranges. The snippet shows how to fill the selection range for plants. SIGN defines to Include or Exclude the selection. OPTION defines the operator. The columns LOW and HIGH are for the values.

The sample shows how to query an equipment list of all plants between 1000 and 2000 and all equipment of plant 3000.
