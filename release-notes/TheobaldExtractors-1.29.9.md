Added option "Only Structures" in Lookup window for MDX Queries. Enables the same behavior as the "Legacy Metadata Retrieval" option before XU 5.6. This must be set during lookup and can not be changed later. Customers that have Cube extractions which used the "Legacy Metadata retrieval" option before should run the Config Converter again.
